### How to use the code

### Option 1 - Jupyter Notebook

Launch `jupyter notebook` and open `SensorDataAnalysisActivity.ipynb`. 

If you're using the notebook, you won't need to edit any other Python files.

### Option 2 - Python Files

The following files provide functions to help in your code:

- parser_data.py - Process the sensor data recorded on your smartphone to return a list of tuples (for x, y, z axis of the sensor data)


- plot_data.py - Visualizes X,Y,Z of the sensor data as a time-series plot

You will need to fill in the following files:

- constants.py - Placeholder for data folder and data file name

- task2.py - template code for Task 2

- util.py - Utility functions for low pass filter

- task3.py - template code for Task 3
